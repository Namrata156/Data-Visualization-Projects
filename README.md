Welcome to the Data Visualization Projects repository!

In this repository, you'll find a series of data visualization projects that I've worked on. These projects cover a wide range of topics and datasets, employing various visualization libraries and tools.

# Projects

# 1) Exploring sleeping patterns across lifestyles 
     https://github.com/Namrata156/Data-Visualization-Projects/blob/main/Sleep_health_and_lifestyle_dataset.html
  
• Examined factors influencing sleep quality in 374 people. Sleep duration, quality, and disorders were found to be related to gender, age, BMI, blood pressure, physical activity, and stress levels.

• Created Python visualizations with pandas, matplotlib, and seaborn. Engineers slept the longest, women slept more than men, sleep quality decreased with high stress and low activity, and overweight people had more sleep disorders. Use statistical analysis and data visualization skills to uncover insights from lifestyle datasets.
