     https://github.com/Namrata156/Data-Visualization-Projects/blob/main/Sleep_health_and_lifestyle_dataset.html
  
•	Analyzed factors influencing sleep quality across 374 individuals. Identified trends in sleep duration, quality, and disorders correlated to gender, age, BMI, blood pressure, physical activity, and stress levels.

•	Developed visualizations in Python using pandas, matplotlib, seaborn. Key findings showed engineers slept longest, women slept more than men, sleep quality declined with high stress and low activity, and overweight people experienced more sleep disorders. Demonstrated ability to uncover insights from lifestyle dataset using statistical analysis and data visualization skills.
